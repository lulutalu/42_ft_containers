# ft_containers
Re-implementation in C++98 of Containers vector, map and stack

## Mandatory

Re-implement in C++98 standard three different containers :

``vector``

``map``

``stack``

There are also some miscellaneous C++98 functions to re-implement :

``std::iterator_traits``

``std::reverse_iterator``

``std::enable_if`` (this one is from C++11 but it should be implemented in a C++98 fashion)

``std::is_integral``

``std::equal`` and/or ``std::lexicographical_compare``

``std::pair``

``std::make_pair``
