# ft_containers
Re-implementation in C++98 of Containers **vector**, **map** and **stack**

# Mandatory

Re-implement in C++98 standard three different containers :

- ``vector``
- ``map``
- ``stack``


There are also some miscellaneous C++98 functions to re-implement :

``std::iterator_traits``

``std::reverse_iterator``

``std::enable_if`` (this one is from C++11 but it should be implemented in a C++98 fashion)

``std::is_integral``

``std::equal`` and/or ``std::lexicographical_compare``

``std::pair``

``std::make_pair``

## Guidelines

- Use the namespace ``ft``
- Use of ``std::allocator`` is mandatory
- Be wary of all the details from existing containers

For all informations about the functionnality and implementation of containers, [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) and [cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/) were very handy
